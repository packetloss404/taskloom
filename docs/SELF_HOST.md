# Self-Host Setup Guide

Taskloom runs as a single Node process. This guide takes you from `git clone` to "I built an app with my own LLM key and ran the generated bundle on my own machine." It is the canonical setup path for Fork B (self-host first).

If you want the strategic background on what self-host *intentionally* gives up versus hosted competitors, see [CLOUD.md](../CLOUD.md).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22.5.0 or later.** Taskloom uses native `tsx` imports and modern ESM features. Check with `node --version`. Use `nvm`, `fnm`, or `volta` if you need to manage multiple versions.
- **npm 10+** (ships with Node 22).
- **OS.** Linux, macOS, or Windows. Tested on Ubuntu 22.04+, macOS 13+, and Windows 11 with PowerShell 7+. WSL2 is also supported and recommended on Windows for the Docker sandbox path.
- **Disk.** ~500 MB for `node_modules`, plus space for generated app workspaces and SQLite data under `data/`. Budget at least 2 GB free.
- **Memory.** ~512 MB resident for the API process, ~512 MB for the Vite dev server, plus whatever the sandbox uses when active.
- **Docker** (optional but recommended). Required for the secure sandbox runtime and for running generated apps from the publish handoff. Without Docker, the sandbox falls back to a `native` host-process driver that is clearly marked **insecure** in the UI.

## 5-Minute Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/packetloss404/taskloom.git
cd taskloom
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:7341** in your browser.

Sign in with the seeded developer account:

- Email: `alpha@taskloom.local`
- Password: `demo12345`

You are now in the workbench. The sidebar collapses to four items — Build, Projects, Runs, Admin — and sixteen operator surfaces (Roles, SSO, Secrets, Rate limits, Webhooks, Releases, Storage, Backups, Notifications, Operations, Integrations, Activation, Sandbox, Workflows, Billing, Alerts) live as tabs under `/admin/:tab`. Back-compat redirects mean old per-page URLs still work.

Go to `/builder` (a full-bleed route outside the workbench Shell), choose **Build an app**, and try a starter prompt like `Build a lightweight CRM for renewal tracking`.

**That is the full local loop.** No account creation, no email verification, no credit card. The two processes that started are:

| Port | Process | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `7341` | Vite (web) | React workbench UI, proxies `/api/*` to the API |
| `8484` | Hono (api) | REST + SSE endpoints, jobs scheduler, sandbox |

If port `7341` or `8484` is already in use, see the troubleshooting section below.

To reset local data back to the seed state at any time, stop the dev server and run `npm run store:reset`.

## Configure your LLM key (the Fork B step)

Taskloom does not ship with a bundled LLM key. You bring your own — this is the central tradeoff of Fork B. Without a key, the builder falls back to **template-only generation**: deterministic, no LLM round-trip, useful for verifying the workbench is wired up but not for producing real apps from open-ended prompts.

### What is wired in today

Honest snapshot of where multi-provider BYOK actually stands:

- **Builder draft + iteration**: Routed through `ProviderRouter`. Six providers are first-class — Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, MiniMax, and a generic local-LLM provider (Ollama / vLLM / LM Studio / llama.cpp). The Builder UI exposes four presets (`fast`, `smart`, `cheap`, `local`) and surfaces the resolved provider+model on each chip.
- **Agent runs**: Same `ProviderRouter` instance — agents pick provider+model per run.
- **Default**: Anthropic wins the default `fast` and `smart` priority walks when its key is present. The `local` preset is strict: it only routes to the local-LLM provider and returns null (template-only fallback) if nothing local is reachable.
- **Override**: Set `TASKLOOM_PROVIDER_PRIORITY=ollama,openrouter,anthropic` to re-order every preset's walk. Hit `GET /api/app/builder/providers/status` to see what is actually resolved at runtime, without exposing any keys.

If you want to drive the builder with an LLM, configure one of the six provider blocks below. If you configure several, the priority walk (or your `TASKLOOM_PROVIDER_PRIORITY` override) decides which one each preset picks.

### Where to put the key

You can configure keys two ways:

1. **Per-workspace in the workbench** (recommended for most users). Open **Admin → Integrations** in the workbench. Paste your key. It is stored in the encrypted secrets vault (AES-256-GCM at rest), never logged, never sent anywhere except to the LLM provider you selected.
2. **As environment variables at startup** (useful for headless installs or Docker Compose). Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the variables below.

Configure **only the providers you actually use**. You do not need all of them.

### Option A — Anthropic Claude (default)

```bash
# .env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Get a key at https://console.anthropic.com. The default model Taskloom targets is `claude-sonnet-4-6` — a good balance of cost, latency, and quality for builder workloads. The `smart` preset upgrades to `claude-opus-4-7`; the `cheap` preset drops to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`. Anthropic wins the default priority walk for `fast` and `smart` when its key is present.

Reference: https://docs.claude.com/en/api

### Option B — OpenAI

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Get a key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys. Preset model picks: `fast` / `cheap` → `gpt-4o-mini`, `smart` → `gpt-4o`. OpenAI is second on the default `fast` / `smart` walks (after Anthropic), and third on `cheap` (after OpenRouter and Gemini).

### Option C — Gemini (Google)

```bash
# .env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
# or, equivalently:
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

Either env name is accepted. Get a key at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey. The Gemini adapter speaks Google's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so it slots into the router with the same shape as OpenAI. Preset picks: `fast` / `cheap` → `gemini-2.5-flash`, `smart` → `gemini-2.5-pro`. Gemini is registered only when one of the two env vars is present (no vault path yet).

### Option D — OpenRouter

```bash
# .env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```

Get a key at https://openrouter.ai/keys. OpenRouter is a model marketplace that exposes Anthropic, Google, Mistral, DeepSeek, and others behind a single OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Preset picks: `fast` / `cheap` → `google/gemini-2.5-flash`, `smart` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`. OpenRouter is first on the default `cheap` walk because its marketplace pricing tends to undercut direct provider keys. Registered only when the env var is present.

### Option E — MiniMax

```bash
# .env
MINIMAX_API_KEY=...
```

Configured the same way as Anthropic / OpenAI. Useful when you want a non-Anthropic, non-OpenAI option for agent runs. MiniMax is registered unconditionally; the preset resolver only picks it when it appears in your `TASKLOOM_PROVIDER_PRIORITY` override (it is not in the default priority walks).

### Option F — Local LLM (Ollama / vLLM / LM Studio / remote llama.cpp)

The "ollama" provider is intentionally generic: it can talk to **any OpenAI-compatible local LLM server**, on `localhost` or on a separate machine on your LAN (think: a beefy GPU box). It is registered unconditionally — but it is **not the default** for hosted presets. Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini / OpenRouter take precedence unless you (a) explicitly request the `local` preset, or (b) set `TASKLOOM_PROVIDER_PRIORITY=ollama,...`.

Three env vars control where requests go and how they're shaped:

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL` | unset | Base URL of the local LLM server. Takes precedence over `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`. Use this for non-Ollama servers (vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp) — it documents intent. |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Legacy synonym for `LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL`. Honored when `LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL` is unset. |
| `LOCAL_LLM_API_FORMAT` | `ollama` | Either `ollama` (native `/api/chat`) or `openai` (`/v1/chat/completions`). Set to `openai` for vLLM, LM Studio, and llama.cpp's OpenAI-compat server. |
| `LOCAL_LLM_MODEL` | unset | Overrides the per-call model name. Useful when the remote server only loads one specific model. |

**Recipe 1: Local Ollama (zero config).** No env needed; Taskloom hits `http://localhost:11434` by default.

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b
# Taskloom will pick this up automatically when the `local` preset is selected.
```

**Recipe 2: Remote Ollama on another box (same LAN).**

```bash
# .env
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.100:11434
```

Run Ollama on the GPU box with `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 ollama serve` so it binds to the LAN interface, not just localhost.

**Recipe 3: vLLM on a remote GPU machine.**

```bash
# .env
LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL=http://gpu-box:8000
LOCAL_LLM_API_FORMAT=openai
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct
```

Start vLLM with e.g. `vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`. `LOCAL_LLM_MODEL` is required because vLLM only serves the one model that was loaded at startup, and its OpenAI-compat layer matches model names strictly.

**Recipe 4: LM Studio (local app on a developer laptop).**

```bash
# .env
LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234
LOCAL_LLM_API_FORMAT=openai
```

In LM Studio, load a model and start the "Local Server" tab. Default port is `1234`. LM Studio exposes the OpenAI-compatible API.

**Recipe 5: llama.cpp's OpenAI-compatible server.**

```bash
# .env
LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
LOCAL_LLM_API_FORMAT=openai
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=deepseek-coder-v2
```

Run llama.cpp with `./llama-server -m deepseek-coder-v2.gguf --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0`. Same caveat as vLLM: set `LOCAL_LLM_MODEL` to whatever name your server reports.

**Quality caveat.** Smaller local models (7B–13B) produce noticeably worse generated apps than Claude / GPT-4-class hosted models. For real builder workloads on local hardware, plan to run `qwen2.5-coder:32b` or larger. The Phase 3 plan calls out `qwen3-coder-next` (80B MoE, 3B active) as the local sweet spot.

The local provider is registered unconditionally, but it is not in the default `fast` / `smart` / `cheap` priority walks — Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini / OpenRouter come first. To make local the preferred path, either pick the `local` Builder preset (strict: only routes local) or set `TASKLOOM_PROVIDER_PRIORITY=ollama,...` (see the next section).

### Option G — No key (template-only fallback)

If no provider key is set and no local server is reachable, the builder falls back to deterministic template-only generation. This is fine for:

- Verifying the workbench is wired up end-to-end.
- Running the sandbox and publish handoff against the bundled CRM template.
- CI / smoke tests that should not consume LLM tokens.

It is **not** sufficient for producing real apps from open-ended prompts — the LLM step is what turns "build a lightweight CRM for renewal tracking" into a tailored brief, plan, and source files.

### Provider precedence and override

The Builder UI exposes four presets — `fast`, `smart`, `cheap`, `local`. Each preset walks a priority list of providers and picks the first one that is both registered on the router and has a configured key (env or vault). The default walks are:

| Preset | Default priority (first match wins) |
| --- | --- |
| `fast` | `anthropic` → `openai` → `gemini` → `openrouter` → `ollama` |
| `smart` | `anthropic` → `openai` → `gemini` → `openrouter` → `ollama` |
| `cheap` | `openrouter` → `gemini` → `openai` → `anthropic` → `ollama` |
| `local` | `ollama` (strict — returns null if no local provider is reachable) |

Set `TASKLOOM_PROVIDER_PRIORITY` to replace the walk for every non-`local` preset:

```bash
# Prefer local LLM for everything; fall back to OpenRouter, then Anthropic.
TASKLOOM_PROVIDER_PRIORITY=ollama,openrouter,anthropic
```

The override is comma-separated, case-insensitive, and silently drops unknown names. The `local` preset is unaffected — it always routes only to local providers.

To confirm what is actually resolved at runtime, call:

```bash
curl -s --cookie-jar /tmp/jar --cookie /tmp/jar \
  http://localhost:8484/api/app/builder/providers/status
```

(Authenticate first; the endpoint requires a signed-in viewer.) The response contains a `presets` map keyed by preset name, an `availableProviders` array of providers with credentials, and the active `priority` override string (or `null` if unset). No secrets are included.

## Deploy your generated app

When you click **Publish handoff** in the builder, Taskloom produces a local package — not a hosted deployment. The package lands under:

```
data/generated-apps/<workspace>/<app>/workspace/
```

It contains the generated React/Vite source files, a `package.json`, a seed schema, an API helper, a migration starter, and a Docker-Compose-ready bundle. The publish handoff panel surfaces the path, the artifact manifest, the smoke-check results, and rollback metadata.

**To run a published app locally:**

```bash
cd data/generated-apps/<workspace>/<app>/workspace
docker compose up
```

The generated app exposes its own health endpoint and serves on its own port (defined in the generated `docker-compose.yml`). Open the port shown in the publish handoff panel — by default it's a free port allocated at generation time, not a hard-coded one.

**To deploy to your own infrastructure:**

The generated bundle is a normal Node app. You can:

- `scp` or `rsync` it to a VPS and run `docker compose up -d` there.
- Push it to a registry and deploy via Kubernetes / Fly Machines / Cloud Run / your own orchestrator.
- Wrap it in your existing CI / CD pipeline — there is nothing Taskloom-specific in the generated artifacts.

DNS, TLS, reverse-proxy, and public URL configuration are your responsibility. The README's **Self-Host Publish** notes link to a reverse-proxy example for local-network / VPN deployment. The tradeoff: you own the URL and the certificate, end-to-end, with no vendor in the path.

For hosted-only conveniences Taskloom does not ship (free public subdomain, auto TLS, managed App Store submission, hosted OAuth proxy), see [CLOUD.md](../CLOUD.md) for the full deferred-features inventory.

## Troubleshooting

### "No API key configured" / builder produces only template output

The builder fell back to template-only generation because the preset resolver could not find a usable provider. Check, in order:

1. Open **Admin → Integrations** in the workbench, or inspect `.env`. Is at least one of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, or `LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL` / `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` configured?
2. Hit `GET /api/app/builder/providers/status` (cookie-authenticated) and look at the `presets` map. If every preset is `null`, the resolver sees no usable provider. If only `local` is `null` but you set `LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL`, the server is unreachable — try `curl $LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL/api/tags` (Ollama) or `/v1/models` (OpenAI-compat).
3. If you set the key via `.env`, did you restart `npm run dev` after editing the file? `.env` is read at process startup, not on every request.
4. Test the key directly against the provider's own API. For Anthropic: `curl -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","max_tokens":16,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'`. If this fails, the problem is the key or the provider, not Taskloom.

### Port collision (`EADDRINUSE` on 7341 or 8484)

Another process is already bound to one of Taskloom's ports.

- Find what's using the port (Linux/macOS): `lsof -i :7341` or `lsof -i :8484`.
- Find what's using the port (Windows PowerShell): `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 7341` or `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8484`.
- Either stop the conflicting process, or override Taskloom's API port: `PORT=9090 npm run dev`. The Vite dev port is set in `web/vite.config.ts` if you need to change it.

### Missing native deps on `npm install` (`better-sqlite3`, `playwright`)

Some optional dependencies build native code. If `npm install` fails:

- On Linux, ensure `build-essential`, `python3`, and `make` are installed (`sudo apt install build-essential python3`).
- On macOS, ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed (`xcode-select --install`).
- On Windows, install the Visual Studio Build Tools (the `Desktop development with C++` workload) or use WSL2.
- For Playwright specifically, after install run `npx playwright install chromium` to fetch the browser binary.

### Generated app preview shows a blank page

The generated app is served from disk through the API at `/api/app/generated-apps/:appId/preview`. If the preview is blank:

1. Check the **Generated source** tab — are files actually written under `data/generated-apps/...`?
2. Open the browser devtools network tab and check for 404s or CORS errors on `/api/app/generated-apps/:appId/preview/...`.
3. If smoke checks failed, the publish handoff panel will list which checks blocked the preview; rerun them after fixing the underlying issue.

### Docker sandbox not available

The sandbox runtime defaults to `docker`. If Docker is not installed or not running:

- The workbench Sandbox panel will show `Docker not available`.
- You can switch to the `native` host-process driver with `TASKLOOM_SANDBOX_DRIVER=native` plus `TASKLOOM_ALLOW_INSECURE_NATIVE_SANDBOX=true`. **This runs sandbox commands as the host user with no isolation.** Only do this on a trusted dev machine.
- For production, install Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or `docker-ce` (Linux), confirm `docker ps` works for your user, and restart Taskloom.

### Reset everything

```bash
npm run store:reset   # JSON store
# or
npm run db:reset      # SQLite store
```

Both stop short of deleting generated app workspaces under `data/generated-apps/`. Remove that directory manually if you want a fully clean slate.
