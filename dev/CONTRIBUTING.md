# Contributing to Taskloom

Taskloom is MIT-licensed, self-hosted, and built in the open. PRs are welcome. For non-trivial changes please open an issue first so we can align on scope before you write code.

## Getting started

Requires Node 22.5 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/packetloss404/taskloom.git
cd taskloom
npm install
npm run dev
```

Two processes start in parallel:

| Port | Process | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `7341` | Vite (web) | React workbench at <http://localhost:7341>; proxies `/api/*` to the API. |
| `8484` | Hono (api) | REST + SSE endpoints, scheduled jobs, sandbox driver. |

Open <http://localhost:7341> and sign in with one of the seeded development accounts. Password is `demo12345` for all three.

- `alpha@taskloom.local`
- `beta@taskloom.local`
- `gamma@taskloom.local`

These credentials are dev-only — do not enable them in any deployment that anyone outside your laptop can reach. To wipe local state and restart from a clean seed, stop the dev server and run `npm run store:reset`.

## Codebase layout

| Path | What lives there |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| `src/server.ts` | Hono entrypoint; mounts every route module. |
| `src/*-routes.ts` | HTTP route handlers, one module per surface (`app-routes.ts`, `auth-session-workspace-onboarding-routes.ts`, `webhook-routes.ts`, `sandbox-routes.ts`, `health-routes.ts`, `operations-*-routes.ts`, ...). |
| `src/*-service.ts` | Domain services that the routes call into (`app-builder-service.ts`, `app-iteration-service.ts`, `app-publish-service.ts`, ...). |
| `src/agent-templates.ts` | Six built-in agent templates surfaced in the workbench gallery. |
| `src/integration-marketplace.ts` | Integration registry. |
| `src/db/`, `src/jobs.ts`, `src/jobs/` | Persistence + job queue. |
| `src/deployment/` | Operator-facing readiness/topology CLIs (`npm run deployment:*`). |
| `web/src/App.tsx`, `web/src/main.tsx` | React workbench entrypoint. |
| `web/src/workbench/views/` | One file per workbench screen — `builder.tsx`, `agents.tsx`, `runs.tsx`, `run-detail.tsx`, `workflows.tsx`, `integrations.tsx`, `operations.tsx`, `secrets.tsx`, `webhooks.tsx`, `sandbox.tsx`, etc. |
| `web/src/lib/api.ts` | Single typed API client used by every view. |
| `web/src/index.css`, `web/tailwind.config.js` | Theme tokens and class primitives. |

Test files sit next to the code they exercise:

- API tests: `src/**/*.test.ts`, run under `node --test` via `tsx`.
- Web tests: `web/src/**/*.test.tsx`, run under the same harness.

## Running tests

All scripts are defined in [`package.json`](../package.json).

```bash
npm test           # API + web tests
npm run test:api   # API tests only
npm run test:web   # Web tests only
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit for both tsconfigs
```

For the full release gate (web bundle + typecheck + tests), run:

```bash
npm run build
```

`npm run build` is what CI runs and what you should run before opening a PR.

## Building

`npm run build:web` produces a static bundle at `web/dist/` that the API serves when you run `npm start`. The `web/dist/` directory is gitignored — rebuild locally rather than committing it.

```bash
npm run build:web
npm start          # serves API + bundled web on :8484
```

## Style and conventions

- **TypeScript strict** everywhere. No `any` without a comment explaining why.
- **Hono routes** live in `src/*-routes.ts`. Keep handlers thin and push logic into a sibling `*-service.ts` so it can be tested directly.
- **React workbench** is React 19 + Vite, mounted at `/`. New screens go in `web/src/workbench/views/` and are wired through the existing router.
- **Theme**. Silver / grey / green-light, defined in `web/src/index.css` and `web/tailwind.config.js`. Reuse the existing class primitives instead of inventing one-off styles:
  - `.kicker`, `.kicker-amber` — small uppercase section labels.
  - `.btn-primary`, `.btn-ghost` — the two button variants.
  - `.pill` (with `.pill--good`, `.pill--warn`, `.pill--danger`, `.pill--info`, `.pill--muted`) — status chips.
  - `.field`, `.label` — form input + label pair.
  - `.spec-frame`, `.spec-frame--tight` — card surface used across the workbench.
  - `.tabbar` + `.tab` (and `.tab-strip` / `.tab-strip__item` for the alternate variant) — tabbed navigation.
- **No new dependencies** without discussion in an issue or PR. The dependency list in `package.json` is intentionally small.
- **Tests are required** for new behaviour. Co-locate them with the code (`foo.ts` -> `foo.test.ts`).

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repo and create a topic branch off `main`.
2. Make your changes. Add or update tests.
3. Run `npm run build`. Fix anything it surfaces.
4. Open a PR against `main`.

Commit messages: subject in imperative mood, under 70 characters; body explains the *why* (what problem this solves, what alternatives were considered) rather than restating the diff. Squash trivial fixups before opening the PR.

## Reporting issues

Bug reports, feature requests, and design discussion all go to GitHub Issues:

<https://github.com/packetloss404/taskloom/issues>

When filing a bug, include the Taskloom version, Node version, OS, and the steps to reproduce. For security issues, please do not file a public issue — open a draft security advisory on the repository instead.
