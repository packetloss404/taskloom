# Invitation Email

Taskloom delegates invitation email delivery. The app records every send attempt as an `invitationEmailDeliveries` row, retries failed handoffs through its built-in scheduler, and accepts inbound provider-status webhooks so deliveries that succeed out-of-band can be reconciled.

## Modes

`TASKLOOM_INVITATION_EMAIL_MODE` selects the delivery path:

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `dev` (default) | Records local "sent" deliveries against the active store. The app does not actually transmit email. Suitable for local development and tests. |
| `skip` (aliases: `skipped`, `disabled`) | Records "skipped" deliveries. No outbound traffic, no retries. Use when invitations are managed entirely outside Taskloom. |
| `webhook` | Posts each create/resend handoff to `TASKLOOM_INVITATION_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL`. Use for production with your own provider or a small webhook-worker translator. |

Failed `webhook` handoffs (configuration errors, timeouts, rejected fetches, non-2xx responses) enqueue an `invitation.email` retry job. The local `dev` and `skip` modes do not enqueue retries; they are recording adapters only.

## Webhook contract

When `TASKLOOM_INVITATION_EMAIL_MODE=webhook`, Taskloom posts:

```http
POST <TASKLOOM_INVITATION_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL>
Content-Type: application/json
x-taskloom-webhook-secret: <TASKLOOM_INVITATION_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_SECRET>
```

Body:

```json
{
  "workspaceId": "alpha",
  "workspaceName": "Acme",
  "invitationId": "inv_...",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "token": "wkin_...",
  "subject": "You're invited to Acme on Taskloom",
  "action": "create"
}
```

`action` is `create` for new invitations and `resend` for resends. `workspaceName` is optional. `token` is a bearer secret — the receiving worker should redact it from its own logs and never echo it in error strings returned to Taskloom.

The provider or webhook worker should:

- Treat the webhook request as the durable handoff boundary from Taskloom.
- Retry transient provider errors using provider-specific retry controls.
- Dead-letter provider-side failures with enough metadata to reconcile the Taskloom delivery row, especially `workspaceId`, `invitationId`, recipient `email`, and `action`.
- Avoid replaying stale invitation tokens after a resend (a resend rotates the token).
- Keep provider error messages free of invitation tokens before returning them. Taskloom redacts known patterns before storing failure messages, but providers should not rely on that.

## Retry and dead-letter

Taskloom's built-in retry uses the persisted job scheduler:

- Retry jobs are type `invitation.email` and visible through the workspace jobs APIs and Operations UI.
- Total attempts cap at `TASKLOOM_INVITATION_EMAIL_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default `3`).
- Backoff starts at 30 seconds, doubles after each failed attempt, and caps at 1 hour.
- Each failed retry writes a new `failed` delivery row and an activity entry.
- When attempts are exhausted, the job stays `failed`. That failed job is the Taskloom dead-letter record for the delivery retry.
- The retry payload stores only `invitationId`, `action`, and the requesting user id — never the token or recipient email. The retry handler resolves the current invitation token at send time so stale resend tokens are not replayed.
- If the invitation is accepted, revoked, or expired before a retry runs, the retry is marked successful with a `skipped` delivery row instead of sending.

Use Taskloom's failed `invitation.email` jobs to identify exhausted app-side retries. Use provider dashboards, webhook-worker queues, or provider dead-letter tooling for failures after the provider accepts a Taskloom handoff.

## Inbound provider-status webhook

To flip a `failed` delivery to `delivered` (or update the row with a provider status), the provider or webhook worker calls Taskloom back:

```http
POST /api/public/webhooks/invitation-email
Content-Type: application/json
x-taskloom-reconciliation-secret: <TASKLOOM_INVITATION_EMAIL_RECONCILIATION_SECRET>
```

The route returns `503` when the secret env is unset, so the webhook is disabled by default.

Body:

```json
{
  "deliveryId": "<taskloom invitationEmailDeliveries.id>",
  "providerStatus": "delivered | bounced | complained | deferred | dropped | failed",
  "providerDeliveryId": "<provider message id, optional>",
  "providerError": "<provider-side error string, optional>",
  "occurredAt": "<ISO timestamp, optional, defaults to now>"
}
```

Common provider aliases are normalized: `delivery` → `delivered`, `hard_bounce` / `soft_bounce` → `bounced`, `complaint` / `spam` → `complained`, `defer` → `deferred`, `drop` → `dropped`, `fail` / `error` → `failed`.

Responses:

- `200 { "ok": true, "deliveryId", "invitationId", "workspaceId", "providerStatus", "appliedAt" }` on success.
- `400` for malformed JSON, missing fields, or unknown provider statuses.
- `401` when the secret header is missing or wrong.
- `404 { "error": "delivery not found", "deliveryId": "<id>" }` when no row matches.
- `503` when `TASKLOOM_INVITATION_EMAIL_RECONCILIATION_SECRET` is unset.

Treat `4xx` as terminal — do not retry. Treat `5xx` and timeouts as retryable. Re-applying the same status is safe; the delivery row is overwritten with the latest `occurredAt`.

## Reconciliation CLI

For deliveries stuck in `failed` when no inbound webhook is wired, or when the provider confirmed delivery via dashboard but never POSTed a status update:

```bash
# Read-only listing of failed deliveries, newest first.
npm run jobs:reconcile-invitation-emails

# Filter by scope.
npm run jobs:reconcile-invitation-emails -- --workspace-id=alpha --invitation-id=inv_123

# Mark a specific delivery as resolved (equivalent to a 'delivered' provider status).
npm run jobs:reconcile-invitation-emails -- --delivery-id=del_xyz --mark-resolved

# Re-enqueue Taskloom-side retry for a failed delivery.
npm run jobs:reconcile-invitation-emails -- --delivery-id=del_xyz --requeue
```

Output lists `deliveryId`, `invitationId`, `workspaceId`, recipient `email`, `status`, `lastError`, `providerStatus` (if set), and `attemptedAt`. Action flags are mutually exclusive. The CLI never includes invitation tokens in output and never accepts a token as input — use the invitation id or delivery id.

The CLI is a manual reconciliation tool; there is no built-in reconciliation cron. If you need recurring reconciliation, wrap it in a cron entry or scheduled remote agent that calls the inbound webhook for each stuck delivery.
