# Persistence

Taskloom supports three persistence postures. Pick one before your first real deployment; switching later is possible but means a planned migration window.

## Modes

| Mode | Set | Default path | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local JSON | `TASKLOOM_STORE` unset or `json` | `data/taskloom.json` | Local development, demos, evaluation. Not for production. |
| SQLite (single-node) | `TASKLOOM_STORE=sqlite` | `data/taskloom.sqlite` (override with `TASKLOOM_DB_PATH`) | One Taskloom process on one host with a durable local disk. |
| Managed Postgres | `TASKLOOM_STORE` left at default and `DATABASE_URL` (or `TASKLOOM_DATABASE_URL` / `TASKLOOM_MANAGED_DATABASE_URL`) set | n/a | Multiple app processes, durable retention, managed backups, regional failover. |

JSON mode is contributor-friendly: a single file you can read and edit by hand. It is not a production posture; running multiple processes against the same JSON file will corrupt it.

SQLite mode is the lowest-coordination supported production posture. One Node process, one local SQLite file on a local disk. The runtime applies migrations and sets `busy_timeout=5000`, `journal_mode=wal`, `synchronous=normal`, and `foreign_keys=on`. Whole-store mutations use `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` so a stale in-memory cache cannot overwrite newer committed state. SQLite mode does not coordinate writers across processes — it is single-node by design.

Managed Postgres mode is the supported horizontal posture. The runtime detects a managed-database URL on startup and uses the Postgres adapter for app-record storage and the dedicated relational tables (jobs, agent runs, alerts, deliveries, activities, provider calls, activation signals, and metric snapshots). Active-active multi-region writes, Taskloom-owned regional failover, and distributed SQLite are not supported.

## Choosing

- One process, one host, low write volume: SQLite.
- Multiple processes or hosts that need to share state: managed Postgres.
- Anything that needs managed backups, PITR, or regional failover: managed Postgres on a provider that owns those guarantees.

A shared SQLite file across multiple containers, VMs, or hosts (NFS, SMB, EFS, Azure Files, sync tooling, or similar) is not supported. WAL and file locking depend on local filesystem semantics; network filesystems silently break those assumptions.

## Environment variables

| Env var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TASKLOOM_STORE` | `json` | Set to `sqlite` for SQLite mode. Leave at default and supply a managed database URL for managed Postgres. |
| `TASKLOOM_DB_PATH` | `data/taskloom.sqlite` | SQLite file location when `TASKLOOM_STORE=sqlite`. Use a path on a local filesystem, not a network mount. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | unset | Managed Postgres connection URL (also accepted as `TASKLOOM_DATABASE_URL` or `TASKLOOM_MANAGED_DATABASE_URL`). Presence triggers managed-database mode. |
| `MASTER_KEY` | _dev key_ | Vault master passphrase used to derive the AES-256-GCM key for the secrets vault. Set to a deployment-specific secret in production; the dev fallback prints a warning. |

## Backup and restore

For SQLite, Taskloom ships local operational tooling:

```bash
# Inspect schema status: applied migrations, pending migrations.
npm run db:status

# Snapshot the SQLite file. Checkpoints WAL with `pragma wal_checkpoint(full)` before copy.
npm run db:backup -- --backup-path=data/taskloom.sqlite.bak

# Restore from a backup. Copies to a temp database, applies migrations, validates no pending migrations remain, then swaps in.
npm run db:restore -- --backup-path=data/taskloom.sqlite.bak
```

Stop the app before `db:restore`, `db:reset`, or `db:reset-app` so the database is not replaced under a live process. There are no down migrations; rollback means restoring from a known-good backup taken before the change.

For managed Postgres, use the provider's native backup, point-in-time-restore, retention, encryption, and disaster-recovery controls. Local SQLite tooling is not the right backup mechanism for a managed database.

## Migrations

```bash
# Apply pending migrations to the configured store.
npm run db:migrate

# Recreate the SQLite schema and reseed (destructive).
npm run db:reset
```

Migrations run forward only. New collections that get promoted from `app_records` to dedicated tables (jobs, agent runs, alerts, deliveries, activities, provider calls, activation signals, metric snapshots) ship with backfill commands. Run the dry-run first when restoring an old backup:

```bash
npm run db:backfill-jobs -- --dry-run
npm run db:backfill-jobs

npm run db:verify-jobs
```

Each promoted collection has a matching `db:backfill-<collection>` and `db:verify-<collection>` pair. The backfills are idempotent (`INSERT OR REPLACE` keyed on row id), so re-runs are safe.

For managed Postgres, the `db:backfill-managed-postgres` and `db:verify-managed-postgres` commands stage existing JSON or SQLite content into the managed adapter.

## Data location

- JSON mode: `data/taskloom.json` plus a few sidecar files under `data/`.
- SQLite mode: `data/taskloom.sqlite` (or the path in `TASKLOOM_DB_PATH`) plus the WAL/SHM siblings the SQLite engine maintains alongside it.
- Managed Postgres mode: data lives in the database identified by `DATABASE_URL`; nothing on the local disk except the WAL siblings written by the activation-derivation cache when SQLite is also configured for parity.

Back up the entire `data/` directory together. The scheduler leader-lock file (`data/scheduler-leader.json` by default) is recovery-irrelevant runtime state and can be excluded from backups.

## Single-node vs multi-writer

SQLite permits multiple readers and one writer per database file, and Taskloom's SQLite runtime is tuned for low-contention local writes. It does not solve any of the following:

- Request routing across several Node processes.
- Queue scheduler leadership across several app instances (use the leader-election gate documented in [operations](./operations.md)).
- Global write ordering across regions.
- Regional failover, replication conflict handling, or multi-region active-active writes.
- Cross-process abuse-prevention coordination (use the distributed rate limiter documented in [security](./security.md)).

Multi-process and multi-region deployments need managed Postgres plus the optional shared-counter rate limiter and HTTP scheduler coordinator. The supported posture for horizontally scaled writers is one managed Postgres database with multiple Taskloom app processes coordinating through the scheduler leader-election HTTP coordinator. The unsupported postures are: distributed SQLite, active-active multi-region writes, and Taskloom-owned regional database failover or PITR.

## Storage readiness check

```bash
# Advisory report.
npm run deployment:check-storage

# Strict mode: non-zero exit on deployment-blocking findings. Use in release gates.
npm run deployment:check-storage -- --strict
```

The same report is exposed through `GET /api/app/operations/status` as `storageTopology` and rendered in the Operations UI.

## When to introduce dedicated relational repositories

Most app collections still live as `app_records` rows with JSON payloads, with sidecar indexes for query-critical reads. Hot collections (jobs, agent runs, alerts, invitation email deliveries, activities, provider calls, activation signals, and metric snapshots) have already been promoted to dedicated tables.

Promote a new collection to its own table when:

- It needs high-volume filtering, aggregation, retention, reporting, or pagination that cannot be cleanly served by existing indexes.
- Correctness needs row-level constraints, uniqueness, joins, or transactions across specific domain rows rather than whole-store JSON rewrites.
- A workflow needs independent backfills, partial migrations, or operational repair jobs that should not rewrite unrelated collections.
- Multi-process workers or schedulers need explicit claim/lease semantics in database rows.
- Production observability requires database-native query plans and indexes for a domain area.
- A data set has external consumers or integration contracts that should not depend on JSON payload shape inside `app_records`.

When promoting a collection, ship a forward migration, a repository module, an idempotent backfill, a verify command, parity tests across stores, and updated rollback guidance.
