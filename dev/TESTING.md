# Manual Test Plan

End-to-end test plan run before cutting a release. Covers the builder loop, agent loop, workspace setup, providers, sandbox, operations, and the self-host backup round-trip.

Estimated time: 25-35 minutes for a full pass; about 10 minutes for the golden path.

## Prerequisites

- Node `>=22.5.0` and npm.
- Optional: a running Docker daemon so the sandbox driver reports `docker` rather than the insecure `native` fallback.
- Clean working tree.

```bash
npm install
npm run store:seed    # default JSON store; creates seed accounts and workspaces
```

When testing SQLite specifically, set `TASKLOOM_STORE=sqlite`, then run `npm run db:migrate` and `npm run db:seed` before booting the app.

Seed accounts (all password `demo12345`):

| Email | Workspace | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alpha@taskloom.local` | alpha | owner |
| `beta@taskloom.local` | beta | owner |
| `gamma@taskloom.local` | gamma | owner |

To wipe state between full passes:

```bash
npm run store:reset    # JSON store at data/taskloom.json
TASKLOOM_STORE=sqlite npm run db:reset
```

Boot the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:7341/` in development, or `http://localhost:8484/` after `npm run build:web && npm start`.

## Golden Path: Build An App

Sign in → `/builder` → describe an app → preview → iterate → publish.

1. From the unauthenticated sign-in entry, submit `alpha@taskloom.local` / `demo12345`.
2. Confirm you land on `/builder`. The Build mode toggle should show **Build an app** selected.
3. Type a prompt such as `Build a lightweight CRM for renewal tracking`, then click the primary generate action.
4. Confirm a draft renders before any mutation. It should show app name, summary, plan steps, page map, data model, acceptance checks, and warnings/open questions when relevant.
5. Approve the draft. Confirm a new app and checkpoint are created and that a preview path appears.
6. Open the preview link. You should land at `/builder/preview/<workspaceId>/<appId>/...` and see the generated routes load.
7. Submit a refinement prompt such as `Add an inline notes field to Account`. Confirm a dry-run change set is shown before mutation, including affected artifacts, route/privacy changes, acceptance checks, and rollback target.
8. Apply the change. Verify a new checkpoint is recorded and that the previous checkpoint is still listed in builder history.
9. Restore a previous non-current checkpoint from the history panel. Confirm the current pointer, preview state, and build/smoke metadata update.
10. Open the publish area. Walk through publish readiness; confirm missing provider keys, webhook secrets, or base URLs are named by env key without exposing values, and that publish remains private until required checks pass and the user explicitly approves public visibility.

Expected results:

- All builder calls hit `POST /api/app/builder/app-draft`, `POST /api/app/builder/app-draft/apply`, and the iteration / rollback endpoints with no console errors.
- Build/smoke status is visible at every stage, even when status is `not_run`, `blocked`, or `failed`.
- No webhook tokens, API keys, or provider secrets are rendered in full.

## Agent Path: Build An Agent

Same golden flow, but for an agent with a schedule trigger, a webhook trigger, and a manual run.

1. From `/builder`, switch the build mode to **Build an agent**.
2. Type `Create a support triage agent that summarizes new tickets and drafts a reply`. Generate the draft.
3. Verify the draft preview includes name, description, instructions, input schema, recommended trigger, schedule or webhook recommendation, tools, provider/model, starter playbook, sample input, acceptance checks, and readiness warnings.
4. Approve the agent. The save call hits `POST /api/app/builder/agent-draft/approve`.
5. Edit the saved agent: add a webhook trigger via the agent editor (`/agents/:id`). Confirm the webhook URL and secret are shown but the secret is masked or revealable behind an explicit reveal.
6. Add or confirm a schedule trigger (cron expression). Confirm the schedule is shown in the agent overview.
7. Trigger a manual run from the builder run panel or `/runs`. Verify the run appears with transcript, tool calls, output, logs, model/cost, and a status pill.
8. From `/runs/<id>`, retry the run. Confirm a new run is created and that retry events flow through to activation (an `agent.run.retry` activity is recorded).
9. Trigger the webhook with `curl` against the webhook URL using the configured secret. Confirm a new run is created with `trigger=webhook` metadata.

Expected results:

- Manual, schedule, and webhook triggers each produce a run record visible at `/runs`.
- The retry path is idempotent for the same source run (no duplicate activation signal counts).
- Webhook tokens and API keys are never rendered in full.

## Workspace Setup

Onboarding stages live in `onboardingStates` and progress through:

| Step | Effect on activation facts |
| --- | --- |
| `create_workspace_profile` | sets `briefCapturedAt` |
| `define_requirements` | sets `requirementsDefinedAt` |
| `define_plan` | sets `planDefinedAt` |
| `start_implementation` | sets `implementationStartedAt`, `startedAt` |
| `validate` | sets `testsPassedAt`, `validationPassedAt`, `completedAt` |
| `confirm_release` | sets `releaseConfirmedAt`, `releasedAt` |

In a private window, sign up a fresh account at `/sign-up`. Walk through each onboarding step from the dashboard or activation view and confirm:

1. The dashboard "activation steps complete" counter increments.
2. The `/activation` view stage label moves through Discovery → Definition → Implementation → Validation → Complete as expected.
3. `GET /api/app/activation` and `GET /api/activation/:workspaceId` reflect the same status.
4. Sign-out returns to the unauthenticated sign-in entry.

Reset between passes by deleting `data/taskloom.json` or running `npm run store:reset` for the JSON store. For SQLite, run `TASKLOOM_STORE=sqlite npm run db:reset`.

## Provider Configuration

1. Sign in as `alpha@taskloom.local` and visit `/integrations`. The breadcrumb reads "Providers".
2. Confirm the page lists configured model providers with one of: `connected`, `missing_key`, or another status pill.
3. Click **Add provider**. Add an Anthropic, OpenAI, or Ollama key.
4. Save and refresh. The new provider should now show `connected`. The status counter at the top of the page should update.
5. Verify the key is stored in the workspace vault, never echoed back. Re-opening the row should show only a redacted preview.
6. Switch to the **Tools** section and confirm the tool registry renders. Switch to **Environment** and confirm env vars render with secret values masked.

Optional: open `/builder` and re-run an app draft. The provider readiness section should now report the configured provider.

## Sandbox

1. Visit `/sandbox`.
2. Confirm the status panel shows the active driver. With Docker running it reports `docker`; without Docker it falls back to `native` and is marked insecure.
3. List sandbox runtimes. Pick a ready runtime in the composer.
4. Run `echo hello sandbox` with working directory `/workspace`. Confirm the run appears in the executions table with status `success` and exit code `0`, and that stdout shows `hello sandbox` in the selected exec panel.
5. Run a long sleep (`sleep 30`) and click cancel. Confirm the run transitions to `canceled`.
6. Filter the executions table by `failed` and `success` to confirm filters work.

Optional smoke integration:

1. Stop the dev server.
2. Set `TASKLOOM_SANDBOX_SMOKE_ENABLED=1` and restart.
3. Sign in and apply an app draft from `/builder` with smoke checks enabled.
4. Verify the smoke section names the sandbox driver. If the sandbox is unavailable, confirm fallback smoke status is explicit and actionable.

## Operations Sanity

1. Visit `/operations`.
2. Confirm subsystem health renders. Subsystems should be `ok`; degraded or `down` entries warrant investigation before release.
3. Confirm the alert list. Active alerts should be zero unless the release is deliberately introducing one.
4. Confirm job metrics render with last duration, average, p95, and 24h counts. Look for stuck queues (`count24h > 0` but `lastMs` older than expected).
5. Visit `/storage`, `/backups`, and `/releases`. Confirm each renders without errors.
6. Visit `/settings` → **Audit** tab. Confirm recent activity entries are present.

Run from the command line:

```bash
npm run jobs:recompute-activation         # refreshes activation read models
npm run jobs:repair-activation            # refreshes stale read models
TASKLOOM_STORE=sqlite npm run db:status   # inspects pending SQLite migrations
```

Each should exit `0` with no warnings.

## Self-Host Sanity

SQLite backup → restart → restore → confirm data round-trips. Use this section when `TASKLOOM_STORE=sqlite`.

1. With seed data loaded, run:

   ```bash
   TASKLOOM_STORE=sqlite npm run db:backup -- --backup-path=data/taskloom.sqlite.bak
   ```

2. Confirm a backup file is written.
3. Stop the server. Modify the database (sign in, create an app draft, apply it).
4. Run the restore:

   ```bash
   TASKLOOM_STORE=sqlite npm run db:restore -- --backup-path=data/taskloom.sqlite.bak
   ```

5. Restart the server and sign in. Confirm the app draft created in step 3 is gone and the seed data is restored exactly.
6. For the JSON store path, repeat with `npm run store:reset` to confirm `data/taskloom.json` resets to the built-in seed state on next start.

## Build And Tests

Run the layers relevant to the change being shipped:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run test:api
npm run test:web
npm run build
```

Acceptance:

- Each command exits `0`.
- No new TypeScript errors.
- A production bundle exists under `web/dist/` after `npm run build:web` or `npm run build`. Do not commit it.

## Public Share And 404

1. Generate a share token from `/settings` → **Share tokens**.
2. Open `/share/<token>` in a private window. Confirm it renders without auth, hides the workbench sidebar, and exposes a sign-in link.
3. Visit an unknown route such as `/this-does-not-exist`. Confirm a styled 404 renders and the primary recovery action returns signed-in users to `/builder` and signed-out users to `/`.

## Command Palette

1. Press **Cmd+K** or **Ctrl+K** in any signed-in view.
2. Confirm the modal opens, typing filters entries, and arrow keys + enter + escape work.
3. Confirm builder and new-build entries are prominent and Advanced operations entries are present but grouped under Advanced.

## Bug Capture

If an acceptance line fails, capture the network request/response and browser console output. Reference the section name in the bug title, for example `Manual Test - Provider configuration: key save returns 500`.
